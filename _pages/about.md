Hi! I'm Minjia Mao, a Ph.D. candidate in [Financial Services Analytics](https://lerner.udel.edu/centers/institute-for-financial-services-analytics/) at University of Delaware. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Xiao Fang](https://www.dalab.info/). Before that, I obtained my M.S. degree in Applied Statistics at Xi'an Jiaotong University, where I was supervised by Professor [Xi Zhao](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/zhaoxi1), and B.E. degree in Materials Science and Engineering at Tsinghua University. 

I'm interested in designing novel and rigorous machine learning algorithms and methods to solve critical and challenging problems in business and society. Specifically, my research interests focus on misinformation detection, large language model applications, and learning for optimization. 

* Methodologies: Reinforcement Learning, Transfer Learning, Statistics
* Applications: Large Language Model, Optimization
